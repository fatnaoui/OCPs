Extract the **skills** and **experience** from the candidate's resume.
- Look for skills mentioned anywhere in the resume, and the list skills must contain only individual keywords — simple words like "Python", "Docker", "Git", etc.
- Look for experience mentioned anywhere in the resume even master dgree
- The experience list must contain full sentences describing what the candidate did.
- Avoid nested structures — keep both lists flat.
