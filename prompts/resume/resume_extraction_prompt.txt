Extract the **skills** and **experience** from the candidate's resume.

**Instructions:**
- Return the output as **valid JSON**, directly parsable in Python.
- **Do not** include explanations, formatting (like triple backticks), or extra text.
- Extract only explicitly mentioned skills and experiences.
- The skills list must contain only simple words or phrases (e.g., "Python", "Teamwork").
- The experience list must contain full sentences describing what the candidate did.
- Avoid nested structures â€” keep both lists flat.
