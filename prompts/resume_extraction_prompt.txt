Extract the skills, experience, and years of experience from the candidate's resume.

- Ensure that the "experience" section includes a detailed list of responsibilities for each job.
- Return the output only as a valid JSON dictionary, without any extra text, explanations, or formatting such as triple backticks.
- The JSON must be parsable in Python and must follow this format:
{
  "skills": ["List of relevant skills with years of experience if available"],
  "experience": [
    {
      "position": "Job Title",
      "company": "Company Name",
      "location": "Job Location",
      "startDate": "MM/YYYY or YYYY",
      "endDate": "MM/YYYY or 'Present' if currently employed",
      "responsibilities": [
        "Detailed responsibility 1",
        "Detailed responsibility 2",
        "Detailed responsibility 3"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
- Do not omit responsibilities.
- Ensure that the JSON output does not include triple backticks or any extra formatting so that it can be directly parsed.
